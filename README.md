## Introduction

This repository contains templates (gitignore, Makefile, main and header) I use to create a minimal C project, or library, at EPITECH.

This is my way of doing things, it worked for all of my projects and is compliant to the EPITECH coding style (as of 2019), but if you find a better way to create C projects, or if you know good practices I didn't use in this repo, [share it with the community, make a pull request!](https://github.com/fanfan54/EPITECHtemplate-c-project/compare) :smile:

:warning: **THIS CODE IS OPEN SOURCE, BUT REUSE IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS, GITHUB PLAGIARISM IS SEVERELY PUNISHED IN MOST SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES!** :cop:

:warning: **CE CODE EST OPEN SOURCE, MAIS RÉUTILISEZ-LE À VOS RISQUES ET PÉRILS, LE PLAGIAT EST SÉVÈREMENT PUNI DANS LA PLUPART DES ÉCOLES !** :cop:
